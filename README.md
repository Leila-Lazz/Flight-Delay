# Flight Delay Predictor (Classification)

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict whether a flight will be **delayed** or **on time/early** using historical flight and operational features. It aims to help airlines anticipate disruptions and reduce operational costs and delay-related fees. [conversation_history:6]

## Key features
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (schedule, route, carrier/airport-related variables, etc.)
- Training and evaluation of classification models
- Model performance reporting (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Tech stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- (Add the model libraries you used)

## Project structure
- `notebooks/` (or main `.ipynb`): analysis + training pipeline
- `data/`: dataset (optional, if not too large / not private)
- `reports/` or `images/`: figures and results (optional)
